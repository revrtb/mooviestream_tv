        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Mooviestream (“we”, “us”, “our”). We are committed to providing you with an excellent streaming experience. This Privacy Policy explains how we operate in relation to user information.</p>
        
        <h2>2. No Collection or Use of Personal Information</h2>
        <p>We do not collect, store or use any personal information, contact data, browsing history, IP addresses or other technical data from our users. We simply provide a platform that serves as a middleware to stream content made available by third-party services. All streaming content is provided by non-affiliated third-party services; we do not host or control the content.</p>
        
        <h2>3. Cookies and User Experience</h2>
        <p>We use cookies (and similar local storage technologies) for the sole purpose of improving your experience on our site — for example, by remembering user interface preferences or ensuring smoother navigation. These cookies do not collect personal or identifying information, nor are they used to build user profiles or track you across sites.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Responsibility for Third-Party Content</h2>
        <p>Our site functions as an intermediary and does not own, host or control the streaming content. All content is provided by external third-party services. We are not responsible for the data practices or privacy policies of those third-party services and encourage you to review their policies directly.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy at any time. The date of last revision will be listed at the top of the policy. We recommend that you review this policy periodically.</p>
